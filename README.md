# laplacian smoothing for triangle mesh
Demonstrate how to smooth a triangle mesh using the Laplacian scheme (preserve initial vertex density)

In main.cpp -> smooth_mesh() you can comment or uncomment the 3 available variants:
- iterative smoothing (unstable but easy to implement and tweak) 
- explicit (more stable)
- implicit (unconditionaly stable, can stomach any lambda)

GLUT or free glut is need to build.
